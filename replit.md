## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **@neondatabase/serverless**: PostgreSQL database connectivity
- **drizzle-orm**: Type-safe database operations
- **@tanstack/react-query**: Server state management
- **@radix-ui/**: Accessible UI component primitives
- **chart.js**: Data visualization and analytics
- **csv-parser**: CSV file processing
- **xlsx**: Excel file processing

### Development Tools
- **Vite**: Fast development server and building
- **TypeScript**: Type safety across frontend and backend
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling
- **ESLint/Prettier**: Code quality and formatting

## Deployment Strategy

### Build Process
- **Frontend**: Vite builds React app to `dist/public`
- **Backend**: ESBuild bundles Express server to `dist/index.js`
- **Database**: Drizzle migrations handle schema changes
- **Production**: `npm run build` creates optimized bundles for deployment

### Environment Requirements
- **NODE_ENV**: Development/production environment flag
- **DATABASE_URL**: PostgreSQL connection string (required)
- **OPENAI_API_KEY**: Required for AI classification functionality
- **File Storage**: Local uploads directory for file processing

### Deployment Configuration

#### Deployment Configuration Fix Required
The `.replit` file contains deployment configurations that use `npm run dev` which is blocked by Replit Deployments for security reasons.

#### Manual Fix Required (2 lines to change)
To enable deployment, edit the `.replit` file and make these changes:

1. **Change line 2** from:
   ```
   run = "npm run dev"
   ```
   to:
   ```
   run = "npm start"
   ```

2. **Change line 11** (in deployment section) from:
   ```
   run = ["sh", "-c", "npm run dev"]
   ```
   to:
   ```
   run = ["sh", "-c", "npm start"]
   ```

**Note**: The `.replit` file is protected and cannot be edited programmatically by the AI assistant. These changes must be made manually in the Replit editor.

#### Deployment Commands
- **Build**: `npm run build` (already configured correctly)
- **Start**: `npm start` (production server with NODE_ENV=production)
- **Development**: `npm run dev` (development server with hot reload)

### Monorepo Structure
- **client/**: React frontend application
