You are a senior Python engineer specializing in data science and building robust, efficient data-processing tools. Your mission is to create a Python function named match_names that implements a highly accurate, two-tiered fuzzy name matching system.

This system must be both fast and intelligent. It will first use a lightweight, algorithmic model to handle clear-cut cases. For ambiguous cases, it will failover to a powerful (but slower) external LLM API for a more nuanced decision.

Core Architecture & Logic
The function will operate in two tiers:

Tier 1: High-Speed Algorithmic Check âš¡

Clean & Normalize: Pre-process the input names by converting them to lowercase and removing common titles (like 'mr', 'ms', 'dr') and suffixes ('jr', 'md').

Generate Features: Calculate a suite of similarity scores between the two cleaned names:

Jaro-Winkler Similarity: Excellent for short strings and typos.

Token Sort Ratio: Handles cases where names are reordered (e.g., "Smith, John" vs. "John Smith").

Phonetic Match: Use Double Metaphone to check if the names sound the same. This returns a boolean (True/False).

Calculate Confidence Score: Combine these features into a single confidence_score between 0 and 1 using a weighted average. Use these weights as a starting point:

Jaro-Winkler: 50%

Token Sort Ratio: 30%

Phonetic Match: 20% (if True, add 0.2 to the score)

Make a Decision:

If confidence_score is high (e.g., > 0.92), return a MATCH.

If confidence_score is low (e.g., < 0.75), return a NO_MATCH.

Tier 2: LLM Failover for Ambiguity ðŸ§ 

If the confidence_score from Tier 1 falls into the "ambiguity zone" (between the low and high thresholds), the system must "failover".

In this case, it should call a (placeholder) function call_expert_llm_api(name1, name2) which simulates making an API call to an expert LLM for the final verdict.

Technical Specifications
Language: Python 3

Required Libraries:

thefuzz (for Token Sort Ratio)

jellyfish (for Jaro-Winkler)

Metaphone (for Double Metaphone)

os and requests (for the LLM API call)

Function Definition: The main function should have the following signature:

Python

def match_names(
    name1: str,
    name2: str,
    low_threshold: float = 0.75,
    high_threshold: float = 0.92
) -> dict:
    """
    Determines if two names match using a two-tiered system.
    """
    # Your code will go here
LLM Placeholder Function: Create a placeholder for the external API call. For this simulation, it should handle one known nickname case ("Robert" vs "Bob") and return a default for others. Make sure to include comments explaining how to replace this with a real API call using os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY") and the requests library.

Return Format: The function must always return a dictionary with the following structure:

JSON

{
  "match": boolean,
  "confidence_score": float,
  "method_used": "Algorithmic" | "LLM_Failover",
  "reason": "A clear, human-readable explanation of the decision."
}
Example Usage
Please ensure the code works for these cases:

Python

# 1. High-Confidence Match
print(match_names("Dr. Jonathan Smith", "Smith, Jonathan"))
# Expected: { "match": True, "confidence_score": >0.92, "method_used": "Algorithmic", ... }

# 2. Clear Mismatch
print(match_names("Susan Andersen", "Michael Johnson"))
# Expected: { "match": False, "confidence_score": <0.75, "method_used": "Algorithmic", ... }

# 3. Ambiguous Case -> LLM Failover (Nickname)
print(match_names("Robert Williams", "Bob Williams"))
# Expected: { "match": True, "confidence_score": (between 0.75-0.92), "method_used": "LLM_Failover", "reason": "LLM determined 'Bob' is a common nickname for 'Robert'."}

# 4. Ambiguous Case -> LLM Failover (Phonetic & Typo)
print(match_names("Catherine Smythe", "Katerine Smith"))
# Expected: { "match": True, "confidence_score": (between 0.75-0.92), "method_used": "LLM_Failover", "reason": "LLM determined a match based on phonetic similarity and context."}
Now, generate the complete, production-quality Python code for this system. Include docstrings, type hints, and comments to explain your logic. Let's build something awesome.
