# Production Deployment Guide

## âœ… Mastercard Integration Fixed (8/20/2025)

### What Was Fixed
The system was defaulting to Mastercard's sandbox environment even in production, causing enrichment failures. Now the system automatically detects the environment and uses the correct API endpoints.

### Key Changes
- **Automatic Environment Detection**: When `NODE_ENV=production`, the system uses Mastercard production APIs
- **All Secrets Configured**: All 5 required Mastercard secrets are now in place

### Required Secrets (Already Added)
âœ… `MASTERCARD_KEY` - Private key in PEM format  
âœ… `MASTERCARD_CERT` - Certificate in PEM format  
âœ… `MASTERCARD_KEY_ALIAS` - Key alias from P12 certificate  
âœ… `MASTERCARD_CONSUMER_KEY` - Consumer key from Mastercard  
âœ… `MASTERCARD_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` - Keystore password  

### Environment Configuration
The system now works like this:
- **Production Deployment**: Uses `https://api.mastercard.com/track/search`
- **Development**: Uses `https://sandbox.api.mastercard.com/track/search`

### Deployment Checklist
1. âœ… All Mastercard secrets are configured in Replit Secrets
2. âœ… Code automatically detects production environment
3. âœ… Production API endpoints will be used when deployed
4. âœ… Cancel/delete operations properly clean up Mastercard searches
5. âœ… Background monitoring respects cancelled status

### Testing in Production
After deployment, you can verify Mastercard is working by:
1. Upload a small test file with Mastercard enrichment enabled
2. The enrichment should complete without errors
3. Check the batch details to see Mastercard match results

### Important Notes
- Mastercard searches can take 5-25 minutes to complete
- The system will wait indefinitely for results (no timeouts)
- Every record submitted WILL receive a response
- Large batches (>100 records) are automatically split into multiple searches

## Status
ðŸŸ¢ **READY FOR PRODUCTION** - All issues resolved, secrets configured, environment detection working
