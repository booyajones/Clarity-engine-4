# Mastercard Track Search API - 500 Error Investigation Summary

## Executive Summary
The Mastercard Track Search API integration is experiencing consistent HTTP 500 (Internal Server Error) responses. Authentication has been successfully resolved and is working correctly, but all API requests are failing with server-side errors.

## Current Status
- **Authentication**: ✅ Working correctly (OAuth 1.0a signature verification successful)
- **API Endpoint**: Production environment (https://api.mastercard.com/track/search/bulk-searches)
- **Error Type**: HTTP 500 - "There was an unexpected system error"
- **Consistency**: 100% failure rate on all requests

## Technical Details

### Environment Configuration
- **Consumer Key**: 8Mg4p8h-0kO7rNwUlRfWhRyvQlzRphvEEujbNW8yabd509dd!e09833ad819042f695507b05bdd001230000000000000000
- **Environment**: Production
- **Authentication Method**: OAuth 1.0a with RSA-SHA256 signature
- **Private Key**: Successfully loaded from PEM file
- **Certificate**: P12 keystore configured (alias: Finexio_MasterCard_Production_2025)

### Request Format Examples

#### Minimal Request (Name Only)
```json
{
  "searchItems": [{
    "clientReferenceId": "single_payee",
    "name": "Tesla Inc"
  }]
}
```

#### Full Request (With Address)
```json
{
  "searchItems": [{
    "clientReferenceId": "single_payee",
    "name": "Apple Inc",
    "address": {
      "line1": "1 Apple Park Way",
      "city": "Cupertino",
      "state": "CA",
      "postalCode": "95014",
      "countryCode": "US"
    }
  }]
}
```

### Error Response Pattern
All requests return the same error structure:
```json
{
  "Errors": {
    "Error": [{
      "Source": "Track Search",
      "ReasonCode": "SYSTEM",
      "Description": "There was an unexpected system error.",
      "Recoverable": false,
      "Details": "correlationid: 0.4453d117.[timestamp].[unique_id]"
    }]
  }
}
```

### Sample Correlation IDs

## Root Cause Analysis

### What We've Confirmed
1. **Authentication Working**: Successfully progressed from 403 authentication errors to 500 server errors
2. **OAuth Signature Valid**: The OAuth 1.0a signature generation and verification is correct
3. **API Endpoint Reachable**: The production API endpoint responds to requests
4. **Request Format Valid**: Both minimal and full request formats produce the same 500 error

### Likely Causes
1. **Account Not Activated**: The production account may require activation or additional configuration
2. **Missing Permissions**: The API credentials may lack necessary permissions for Track Search
3. **Service Not Provisioned**: The Track Search service might need to be explicitly enabled for the account
4. **Internal Mastercard Issue**: Server-side problem on Mastercard's infrastructure

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate Steps
1. **Contact Mastercard Support** with:
   - The correlation IDs listed above
   - Confirmation that OAuth authentication is working
   - Request to verify account status and Track Search API access

2. **Verify Account Status**:
   - Confirm production account is fully activated
   - Check if Track Search API requires separate provisioning
   - Verify API access permissions and quotas

3. **Request from Mastercard**:
   - Detailed error logs for the correlation IDs
   - Confirmation of account configuration requirements
   - Any additional setup steps needed for production

### Questions for Mastercard Support
1. Is the Track Search API fully provisioned for our production account?
2. Are there any additional configuration steps required beyond OAuth setup?
3. Are there any known issues with the Track Search API service?
4. What specific permissions or account settings are required for bulk search operations?

## Technical Implementation Status
- ✅ OAuth 1.0a implementation complete and verified
- ✅ Private key extraction and formatting resolved
- ✅ Consumer key updated to production value
- ✅ Request payload formatting matches API documentation
- ❌ Awaiting resolution of server-side 500 errors
